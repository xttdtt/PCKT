# Code notes

Here is the whole process of running the code, please run the code in this order:

1. you should download the dataset and put it into the *data* folder in the corresponding dataset folder. 

   Take dataset *Assist09* as an example:

   Firstly, you need to first create a folder named *Assist09*

   Secondly, create *data* folder inside the *Assist09* folder

   Finally, rename the downloaded dataset to *Assist09_original.csv* and put it into the *data* folder.

   You can download the dataset here:

   *Assist09*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNXHFRxcArrU0ZJSb9BIL56vmUt5FhlE/view

   *Assist12*: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cU6Ft4R3hLqA7G1rIGArVfelSZvc6RxY/view

2. Set non-fixed parameters in *HyperParameter.py*.

3. After setting the non-fixed parameters, you should run the program in the following order, please be sure to run in this order, otherwise errors will be reported: 

   *ProcessData.py*---->*TrainEmbedding.py*---->*JointEmbedding.py*---->*TrainModel.py*

4. The **best acc** and **best auc** in the *TrainModel.py* are the final running results, representing best accuracy and best ROC curve area respectively.

# Packages used

  You can use the following command to install the package:

   ```shell
pip lnstall tensorflow==1.15.0 pandas numpy scipy sklearn
   ```

   The version of python we are using is 3.7.12

   Please do not run this program in the environment of tensorflow 2.0 or higher, we strongly recommend that you use tensorflow 1.15.0 version to run this model. Other packages can use the latest version.
